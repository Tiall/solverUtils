## Current Applications
### Kmap solver
- Allows Inputs from:
    - minterms
    - maxterm
    - logical expression
        - Implements the Shunting-Yard Algorithm to evaluate then utilize the input expression 
    - Don't cares
- (Currently allows up to 4 variable expressions)
- (Doesn't solve the kmaps yet, it just renders them)
### Logical Expression tester
- Allows the user to input a logical expression then fill out the variable values with the output updating dynamically
